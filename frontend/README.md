Project Name: Concurrency and Rate Limiting Demo
-- Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement concurrent requests with rate limiting in a React application. It showcases how to use axios-rate-limit to control the number of requests per second and how to handle asynchronous operations effectively.

-- Technologies Used:
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.   
axios-rate-limit: A middleware for rate limiting HTTP requests.
-- How to Run:
Clone the repository:
Bash
``git clone https://github.com/rudenkoserhii/test-devit.git``
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:
Bash
``cd your-repo-name``
``npm install``   ``

Use code with caution.

Start the development server:
Bash
``npm start``
Use code with caution.

-- Usage:
Enter the desired concurrency limit in the input field.
Click the "Start" button to initiate the requests.
The application will send concurrent requests to the server, respecting the rate limit.
The received responses will be displayed in a list.
-- Key Features:
--- Concurrent Requests: Multiple requests are sent simultaneously, improving performance.
--- Rate Limiting: The axios-rate-limit middleware ensures that the specified number of requests are not exceeded per second.
--- Asynchronous Handling: Asynchronous operations are handled using Promise.all to efficiently process multiple requests.
--- User Interface: A simple UI is provided to input the concurrency limit and display the results.
-- Future Improvements:
--- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to handle network errors, server errors, and other exceptions.
--- User Experience: Enhance the user interface with progress indicators, feedback messages, and error handling.
--- Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
--- Optimization: Explore techniques like caching and lazy loading to improve performance for large-scale applications.
-- Note:

Adjust the maxRequests and maxRPS values in the axios-rate-limit configuration to control the rate limit.
Consider using a more sophisticated state management solution like Redux or Zustand for larger applications.
Explore other rate limiting techniques or libraries if needed.
By understanding the core concepts and applying the techniques demonstrated in this project, you can effectively implement concurrent requests and rate limiting in your React applications.
